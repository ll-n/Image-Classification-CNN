# Image-Classification-CNN
Build an image classifier with Convolutional Neural Networks for the Fashion MNIST dataset

Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

Each image is assigned to one of the ten different fashion categories, making it a multi-class classification problem. The dataset is evenly balanced, with an equal number of images for each category.

By implementing a CNN model, you can effectively categorize different fashion items into their respective classes.
